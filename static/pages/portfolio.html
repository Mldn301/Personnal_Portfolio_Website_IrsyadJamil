HIDS (Host-Based Intrusion Detection System), which is one of the IDS, is a security system that is installed directly on a host (computer, laptop, or server) to detect suspicious or malicious activities that occur within the system.
                For HIDS, we use one of the tools, Wazuh. Wazuh also has a built-in web-based Security Information and Event Management so this is the
                reason we choose this. Then for NIDS we use Suricata to take the role of NIDS"
